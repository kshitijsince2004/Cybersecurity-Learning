# Cybersecurity-Learning

This repository is a record of my journey into the world of cybersecurity.  
Instead of just keeping private notes, I am making my progress public to stay consistent, showcase growth, and hopefully help others who are starting out.

## What You’ll Find Here

- Core concepts: networking, operating systems, and Linux fundamentals  
- Hands-on practice with security tools (Wireshark, Nmap, Burp Suite, etc.)  
- CTF write-ups and lab walkthroughs (TryHackMe, HackTheBox, OverTheWire)  
- Notes, commands, and resources I found useful along the way

## Why I Built This

Cybersecurity cannot be learned only from books. It requires a mix of theory, practice, and reflection.  
This repository is designed to serve as:

- A personal portfolio of what I learn each week  
- A way to track progress and stay consistent  
- A resource that might help others starting in cybersecurity

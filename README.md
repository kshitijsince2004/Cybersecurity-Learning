# Cybersecurity-Learning

This repository is a record of my journey into the world of cybersecurity.  
Instead of just keeping private notes, I am making my progress public to stay consistent, showcase growth, and hopefully help others who are starting out.  

## What You’ll Find Here
- Core concepts: networking, operating systems, and Linux fundamentals  
- Hands-on practice with security tools (Wireshark, Nmap, Burp Suite, etc.)  
- CTF write-ups and lab walkthroughs (TryHackMe, HackTheBox, OverTheWire)  
- Notes, commands, and resources I found useful along the way  

## Why I Built This
Cybersecurity cannot be learned only from books. It requires a mix of theory, practice, and reflection.  
This repository is designed to serve as:  
- A personal portfolio of what I learn each week  
- A way to hold myself accountable to consistent progress  
- A resource that others can reference, adapt, or build upon  

## How I Work
- I spend one hour daily on focused cybersecurity learning  
- Quick notes are captured privately (to stay raw and unfiltered)  
- Twice a week, I clean and publish my progress here in the form of structured notes or lab write-ups  

## Vision
Over time, this repository will grow from basic foundations into advanced security concepts, projects, and original research.  
My aim is to track the full path — from student learning the basics to professional building and breaking real systems.
